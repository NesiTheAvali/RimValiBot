## Variants

RimVali features four avali variants, partly inspired by [FelisRandomis's post here.](https://twitter.com/FelisRandomis/status/1519375403076534273?s=20&t=ZB84enSsSI1v-vskTJxMjw)

Note: Currently, only the Homeworld variant are in the public build.

### "Vanilla"/Homeworld
 These are the Illuminate avali colonists that have come directly from Avalon, most likely as part of some colonization program. They often have more augmentations then their more adapted counterparts, to help them survive the enviroment on the rimworld.
